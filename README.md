## üìÅ Projects Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cat vs Dog Classifier
**Goal:** Classify images as either "Cat" or "Dog" using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

- **Dataset:** [Kaggle Dogs vs Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
- **Techniques:**
  - Image preprocessing with `ImageDataGenerator`
  - Data augmentation for better generalization
  - CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, and Dense layers
- **Results:** Achieved accuracy of ~90% on validation data.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  python cat_dog_classifier.py
  python mnist_digit_recognition.py
2Ô∏è‚É£ Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)
Goal: Recognize digits (0‚Äì9) from handwritten grayscale images.

Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits

Techniques:

Data normalization

Simple CNN architecture

Softmax output layer for multiclass classification

Results: Achieved ~99% test accuracy.

Usage:

3Ô∏è‚É£ Fashion MNIST Classification
Goal: Classify clothing items (e.g., shirts, shoes, coats) from grayscale images.

Dataset: Fashion MNIST

Techniques:

Normalization and reshaping

CNN with batch normalization and dropout

Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling

Results: Achieved ~92% accuracy.

Usage:
